After unpacking the archive, test the sandbox by requesting the following URL:

    http://localhost/sf_sandbox/web/

usual site management operations. For instance, to clear the cache, type:

    $ ./symfony.sh clear-cache                      (*nix)
    symfony clear-cache                             (Windows)

To discover all the available actions of the symfony command line, type:

    $ ./symfony.sh -T                               (*nix)
    symfony -T                                      (Windows)

Environments
------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
The sandbox already contains one application called `frontend`, accessible
through two environments:

- the default environment is the `prod` one, in which the application is fast

>>>>>>> f2da329b505d04b1ba9898a8a210c50bec22a264
  but outputs few error messages
- the `dev` environment is slower but gives access to a lot of information
  about the current request

To access the `frontend` application in the `dev` environment, type:

    http://localhost/sf_sandbox/web/frontend_dev.php/
               (don't forget the final /)

Modules
-------

To create a new module `mymodule`, just type in the command line:

    $ ./symfony.sh init-module frontend mymodule    (*nix)
    symfony init-module frontend mymodule           (Windows)

To access it, call:

    http://localhost/sf_sandbox/web/mymodule

If, at this point, you meet an error, this means that your web server doesn't
support mod_rewrite. Delete the `.htaccess` file from the `web/` directory and
<<<<<<< HEAD
call instead:

What's in the sandbox?
----------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
The sandbox is an empty symfony project where all the required libraries
(symfony, pake, creole, propel and phing) are already included (in the
`sf_sandbox/lib/` directory). It is configured to work without any
configuration if unpacked under the web root, but you can install it anywhere

The sandbox is intended for you to practice with symfony in a local computer,
not really to develop complex applications that may end up on the web.

Beware that the sandbox is not upgradeable.

Happy symfony!

Feel free to experiment and try the various techniques described in the
www.symfony-project.com website. All the tutorials can also work in a sandbox.
But in the long run, if you decide to go on with symfony, we advise you to
switch to a PEAR installation, which will guarantee you with the possibility
