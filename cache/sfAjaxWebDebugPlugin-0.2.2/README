== Author ==

== Overview ==

Did you ever build AJAX applications with Symfony and were disappointed by the fact that the web debug toolbar was not working?

This plugin should solve your problem.

== License ==

For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE
file that was distributed with this source code.

== Compatibility ==

Was tested against Symfony version 1.0.7

== Change log ==
v0.2.0:     Added missing JSON class.

v0.1.0:     First beta release.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin use:
{{{
symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfAjaxWebDebugPlugin
}}}

== Using the plugin ==

The  '''''ajaxWebdebug''''' module should be enabled in the application's settings.

After completing the AJAX request you should call the javascript function '''''getAjaxWebDebug()''''' to update the toolbar.

This plugin requires prototype's '''''Ajax.Request''''' object but since we are dealing with AJAX application I assume that prototype is enabled. If you are not using prototype in your AJAX application then you have to enable it yourself.
